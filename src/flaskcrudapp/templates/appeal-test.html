<h3>Overview</h3>
<p style="margin-bottom: 15px; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.72222; color: rgb(52, 73, 94); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">In this job, you will be presented with conversations between two interalocutors (a conversational system S and a user U). Review the conversation to determine whether the last utterance by S causes a breakdown in the conversation or not.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 15px; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.72222; color: rgb(52, 73, 94); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="color: rgb(209, 72, 65);">This task requires native English skills.<br/>
Please refrain from joining this task if you are a non-native speaker of English.</span></p>
<h3>Step</h3>
<ol style="margin-bottom: 15px; font-size: 15px; color: rgb(52, 73, 94); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">
<li>Read the conversation.</li>
<li>Determine if the last utterance causes a breakdown in the conversation.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Rules &amp; Tips</h3>
<p style="margin-bottom: 15px; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.72222; color: rgb(52, 73, 94); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">For the last utterance of each conversation, you will choose BREAKDOWN, POSSIBLE BREAKDOWN, or NOT A BREAKDOWN:</p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(52, 73, 94); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;">The key notion is 'difficulty in continuing the conversation smoothly'.</span></p>

<h4> Note:</h4>
<p>Consider not only the preceding utterance but also all the given history utterances if exist for making your judgment. There are no objective and concrete criteria to choose between BREAKDOWN, POSSIBLY, and NOT A BREAKDOWN. It is okay to be subjective in making decisions.</p>
<p>Note that emojis are replaced with alternative texts (e.g.,[SMILE])</p>

<tr>
<td>
<p>NOT A BREAKDOWN</p>
<p>In this example, the last utterance is a suitable response to a greeting. So, this is not a breakdown.</p>
</td>

			S: Fine. How about you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p>POSSIBLE BREAKDOWN</p>
<p>​In this example, the last utterance is socially awkward. So this can be labeled a possible breakdown.</p>
</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p>BREAKDOWN</p>
<p>In this example, the last utterance does not make any sense. So,  this will be given a breakdown label.</p>

<p>U: How are you?<br/>
