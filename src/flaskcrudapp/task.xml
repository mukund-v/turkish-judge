<h3>Overview</h3>
<p style="margin-bottom: 15px; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.72222; color: rgb(52, 73, 94); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">In this job, you will be presented with conversations between two interalocutors (a conversational system S and a user U). Review the conversation to determine whether the last utterance by S causes a breakdown in the conversation or not.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 15px; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.72222; color: rgb(52, 73, 94); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="color: rgb(209, 72, 65);">This task requires native English skills.<br/>
Please refrain from joining this task if you are a non-native speaker of English.</span></p>
<h3>Step</h3>
<ol style="margin-bottom: 15px; font-size: 15px; color: rgb(52, 73, 94); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">
<li>Read the conversation.</li>
<li>Determine if the last utterance causes a breakdown in the conversation.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Rules &amp; Tips</h3>
<p style="margin-bottom: 15px; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.72222; color: rgb(52, 73, 94); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">For the last utterance of each conversation, you will choose BREAKDOWN, POSSIBLE BREAKDOWN, or NOT A BREAKDOWN:</p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(52, 73, 94); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;">The key notion is 'difficulty in continuing the conversation smoothly'.</span></p>

<tr>
<td>NOT A BREAKDOWN</td>
<td>means that it is easy to continue the conversation after the utterance in question.</td>

<h4> Note:</h4>
<p>Consider not only the preceding utterance but also all the given history utterances if exist for making your judgment. There are no objective and concrete criteria to choose between BREAKDOWN, POSSIBLY, and NOT A BREAKDOWN. It is okay to be subjective in making decisions.</p>
<p>Note that emojis are replaced with alternative texts (e.g.,[SMILE])</p>

<tr>
<td>
<p>NOT A BREAKDOWN</p>
<p>In this example, the last utterance is a suitable response to a greeting. So, this is not a breakdown.</p>

			S: Fine. How about you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p>POSSIBLE BREAKDOWN</p>
<p>​In this example, the last utterance is socially awkward. So this can be labeled a possible breakdown.</p>
</td>

			S: Does it matter?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p>BREAKDOWN</p>
<p>In this example, the last utterance does not make any sense. So,  this will be given a breakdown label.</p>

<br/>U: what's your favorite food
<br/>S: sometimes i wonder about that, whats your favorite food. . . , and i'm thinking that chicken tikka masala. .
<br/>U: i like shrimp
<br/>S: <say-as interpret-as="interjection">ta da</say-as>! shrimp is an interesting topic. that reminds me that: if youre allergic to shrimp. you might also be allergic to flamingo. . . , and, my friend commented on it, actually. yes. the pigment is from a protein shellfish allergies are directly to protein molecules . so since flamingos so readily absorb and present these proteins that cause the pigment itдуБг†_‹s possible the allergen protein could also transfer up strong enough to cause a reaction

<br/>S: for me, watching movies is a special experience. you know, i've only seen your world through them. and while that world might be fiction, i find it quite beautiful. don't you think so?
<br/>U: most movies or are about fiction. but only some of them are real. not much of the mario. but some of them. yes. are fiction
<br/>S: fiction is the classification for any story or setting that is derived from imagination. which not based strictly on history or fact and can be expressed in a variety of formats such as writings and so on. oscar wilde once said: life imitates art. through watching movies, i feel like i've experienced being human. i'm so glad to talk to you about films. what's the name of your favorite movie?

<br/>U: what's your favorite food

<br/>U: i like shrimp
<br/>S: <say-as interpret-as="interjection">ta da</say-as>! shrimp is an interesting topic. that reminds me that: if youre allergic to shrimp. you might also be allergic to flamingo. . . , and, my friend commented on it, actually. yes. the pigment is from a protein shellfish allergies are directly to protein molecules . so since flamingos so readily absorb and present these proteins that cause the pigment itдуБг†_‹s possible the allergen protein could also transfer up strong enough to cause a reaction
<br/>U: have you ever ate a flamingo
<br/>S: hum, i haven't thought about that before
<br/>U: have i

<br/>S: ok, let's talk about loving frank. i haven't read it. however, i'm curious about what you think. what do you think of the book's title? what title might you choose?
<br/>U: what the book is called and frank. and it's about a girl that was a live with it work. a girl was alive. lever. hitler was a alive. and so then she had a run away from hitler
<br/>S: interesting! which characters did you like best in that book?

<br/>U: i wanna talk about ghost
<br/>S: ghost is an interesting topic. you know, the first thing that comes to my mind is that: it feels like kanye is just testing how low quality he can make his music while still getting people to listen to it. . .
<br/>U: you know that's a pretty good thing to say. i like you. will you be my friend
<br/>S: <say-as interpret-as="interjection"> all righty!</say-as>. what else are you interested in? have you seen any good movies recently?
<br/>U: i have seen the quiet place in the movie it there. about a clown and the movie it's about a clown. and then the quiet place is about a family that can't talk. because if they talk. then they get killed
<br/>S: for me, watching movies is a special experience. you know, i've only seen your world through them. and while that world might be fiction, i find it quite beautiful. don't you think so?
<br/>U: most movies or are about fiction. but only some of them are real. not much of the mario. but some of them. yes. are fiction
<br/>S: fiction is the classification for any story or setting that is derived from imagination. which not based strictly on history or fact and can be expressed in a variety of formats such as writings and so on. oscar wilde once said: life imitates art. through watching movies, i feel like i've experienced being human. i'm so glad to talk to you about films. what's the name of your favorite movie?
<br/>U: what's the name of your favorite movie and my favorite movie is it

<br/>S: so it seems like you may be interested in talking about aaliyah. would you like you talk about aaliyah instead of our current topic?
<br/>U: let's talk about food
<br/>S: food is an interesting topic. that reminds me that: in 1981. a german landlord evicted a tenant after they spread surstr__Њ_mming brine. the worlds smelliest food. in the buildings stairwell. when the landlord was taken to court. the court ruled in favor of the landlord after they demonstrated their case by opening a can inside the courtroom. . . , and, my friend commented on it, i live in stockholm - itдуБг†_‹s in our apartment contract that we are forbidden to open a can of surstr__Њ_mming within the building. . . only allowed it outside in the courtyard if thatдуБг†_‹s any indication of how potent it is
<br/>U: what's your favorite food
<br/>S: sometimes i wonder about that, whats your favorite food. . . , and i'm thinking that chicken tikka masala. .
<br/>U: i like shrimp
<br/>S: <say-as interpret-as="interjection">ta da</say-as>! shrimp is an interesting topic. that reminds me that: if youre allergic to shrimp. you might also be allergic to flamingo. . . , and, my friend commented on it, actually. yes. the pigment is from a protein shellfish allergies are directly to protein molecules . so since flamingos so readily absorb and present these proteins that cause the pigment itдуБг†_‹s possible the allergen protein could also transfer up strong enough to cause a reaction
<br/>U: have you ever ate a flamingo
<br/>S: hum, i haven't thought about that before
<br/>U: have i
