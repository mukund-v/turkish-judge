Review the conversation to determine whether the last utterance by S causes a breakdown in the conversation or not.</p>

<p><span style=""color: rgb(52, 73, 94); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;"">The key notion is 'difficulty in continuing the conversation smoothly'.</span></p>

<h4>&nbsp;Note:</h4>

<p>Consider not only the preceding utterance but also all the given history utterances if exist for making your judgment. There are no objective and concrete criteria to choose between BREAKDOWN, POSSIBLY, and NOT A BREAKDOWN. It is okay to be subjective in making decisions.</p>

<p>Note that emojis are replaced with alternative texts (e.g.,[SMILE])</p>

<br>U: yeah
<br>S: i just learned this fact. that ian hart, the actor who played professor quirrell in harry potter and the sorcerer's stone had to return to stage acting, which he hates, and once lunged at an audience member for talking during a performance. what do you think? interesting?
